You'll need a config.properties file, that will look like:

v1.token=<insert V1 token>
v1.url=<insert V1 url>
v1.planningLevel=<insert ID>  (as in "Scope:#####").  This is only used to find the set of teams to get stories for.
fromClosedDate=2025-01-01  (will find stories closed after this date)
states=Ready for Build, Build, Done (states you want captured)
includeStoryPoints=<false or true>  Whether to include story points in the output.
includeTeamName=<false or true>  Whether to include the team name in the output.


Useful commands:

# Start server
java -jar target/AgilityAccess-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

# Check health
curl http://localhost:7070/health

# Run the extraction
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/api/stories/extract \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"v1.token": "<insert token here>",
  "v1.url": "https://www16.v1host.com/api-examples",
  "v1.planningLevel": "Scope:1005",
  "fromClosedDate": "2025-01-01",
  "states": "Ready for Build, Build, Done",
  "includeStoryPoints": "true",
  "includeTeamName": "true"}'
